# SHUC

## Description

**SHUC** (an Amharic word for whisper) is a home companion robot. It has autonomous navigation capabilities (SLAM + A* path planner) and can interact with people via voice commands. SHUC has a visual attention system that was largely inspired by Professor Cynthia Brazil's work on Kismet robot. SHUC's visual attention system combines bottom-up features like motions in the environment and skin color with top-down features like faces to generate a saliency map. The saliency map is then used for guiding SHUC towards interesting regions in its field of view. Besides voice commands, users can interact with SHUC through a custom built android app. The entire system was built on top of ROS and costs less than 250 USD.
